# BimVision-IfcIsolator

## üîç What is IfcIsolator?

**IfcIsolator** is a BIM Vision plugin designed to help you isolate and extract specific elements from an open IFC model into a separate IFC file.
It runs using the console application built on top of XBim of the [IfcIsolator project](https://github.com/matheushsaba/IfcIsolator).

### ‚ú® What It Does

- Prompts the user select elements.
- Creates a new IFC file containing only the selected elements.

This tool is especially handy when you need to break down complex models into manageable parts or share only relevant components of a project.
